### Binary file I/O using C++
Author: Garrett Strealy

Description:

Use  binary file I/O techniques to open a supplied binary file. The file consists of a
header record that is immediately followed by a set of data records. Read and display the
header record. Using information in the header record, read the data records from the file.
For each data record, display the results in a CDK window. After display, wait
until the user types a character on the keyboard. When they do, exit the program.

This project demonstrates my  ability to create a multi-file project that is hosted in a GIT repository. 
It also demonstrates my ability to perform Binary File I/O, and my ability to visualize binary data using a CDK
matrix.

Completed for the "C/C++ Programming in a UNIX Environment" course at The University of Texas - Dallas.
